      "You enter a once beautiful kitchen, full of what seems to be magical cooking appliances unbeknownst to you.  Wires connect a metal box spitting out blackened bread, and a type of wood stove expels heat from its open furnace at a remarkable heat despite there being no wood.  The top of the stove has four discs burning as bright and red and angry as an armorsmith's furnace.  Fire leaps from a pot on top of one those burning disc just as a horrific repeating squeal comes a tiny circle on the wall.  Seemingly unphased by the obvious chaos around and possible inevitable conflagration, a goblin leaps from chair to table to wall and spots you but seems to not care.  In between several leaps it belches and throws its shoulders against the kitchen island that has been upturned and sits squarely against the pantry door.  What do you do?",
      "You move the kitchen island blocking the door.  He's elated and promises to help you out if you let him come with you.  But right now the kitchen looks like its about to burn down.  Is that stove still on???",
