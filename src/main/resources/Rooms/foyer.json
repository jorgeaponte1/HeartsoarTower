The keyhole is so deeply drilled into the door that your hand cannot fit inside.\n\n To the left you have the castle entrance, and to the right you have what might possibly be the kitchen.\n",
    "You once again enter the gleaming foyer.  To the left is entrance.  To the right is the kitchen.  Up is to a dimly lit room."
