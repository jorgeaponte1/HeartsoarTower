Desc1: Succubus is present
Immediately behind the door you hear a gentle hiss and a rapid tickle on your ear.  You spin around with surprise and fury to find a beautiful woman with black hair cascading down her body.  An aroma of ocean waves seem to embrace you entirely while your childhood memories of the very same beach force you to lower your guard.

Her eyes are narrow like a serpent, and her forked tongue flicks out in a somehow endearing way.  The succubus whispers, "Hello, traveler.  Welcome.  I have sweets, treats, and drinks.  Good stories and good explorations.  I have been alone for far too long; please let's spend us some time together".

What do you do?

Desc2: Succubus not Present.  Gun present.
 You enter back into the Chambre de Plaisir that was once blanketed in red velvet now shows only its dingy grime of the dungeon.  There is a glint of a... gun(?)... in the corner of the room.

 Desc3: Complete
 The dimly lit dungeon holds nothing of interest.
