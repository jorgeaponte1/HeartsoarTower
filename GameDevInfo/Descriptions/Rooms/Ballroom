Desc1: Zombie is present
The grand ballroom is filled with dust-covered chandeliers, crumbling pillars, and faded tapestries. Harmony and her new found friend follows closely behind. They begin exploring the ballroom, their footsteps echoing through the empty space. Suddenly, a low groan interrupts the silence. They freeze, exchanging worried glances.

Harmony's gaze settles on a massive oak door at the far end of the ballroom. She takes a deep breath, gathering her courage. Harmony pushes open the creaking door, revealing a dimly lit chamber. The room is occupied by a solitary zombie, slumped against the wall. Its tattered clothes and vacant eyes speak of a long-forgotten past. The creature seems lost. But it is a zombie, and zombies are dangerous.

What do you do?

 Desc3: Zombie is present, but you have found the key.
 Appearances can be deceiving. Let's see if we can help it.
 Approaching the zombie cautiously, Harmony extends a hand of friendship. The zombie lifts its head, eyes widening with surprise and longing for companionship.

 Hello there. My name is Harmony, and this is my friend, //ghostName//. What's your name?

 The zombie hesitates for a moment, struggling to remember, then manages to utter a single word.  "Mordecai." The zombie says weakly. Harmony's smile grows wider as she realizes the potential for a newfound friendship.

 Well, Mordecai, would you like to join us? We're on a mission to find Prince Timore, and we could use all the help we can get. Mordecai's eyes light up, grateful for the offer of companionship. "Yes... I would like that very much." Whispers Mordecai.

 Together, Harmony, //ghostName//, and their new friend Mordecai venture forth, united by the hope of finding Prince Timore and the power of friendship that can transcend even the darkest of circumstances.
