Desc1: Vamp present
An impossibly handsome vampire sits on an ottoman in the center of a gigantic bedchambers.  A beautiful chandelier catches the light and throws it around the room.  The pale man hangs his head in his hands and doesn't even bother looking up when you enter.  The weirdest thing is the vanity mirror being covered by bedsheets.

Desc2: Vamp not present
You enter the bedchambers to find the vampire just staring at himself in the mirror.  Like... ok we get it, you're beautiful.  To the left you have the den.
