Desc5: Harmony speaks softly, her voice filled with compassion. "Prince Timore, I have journeyed through the depths of darkness to find you and offer you this teddy bear. It may seem like a simple toy, but it carries with it the power to heal wounds and bring comfort. May it remind you that there is still warmth and light in the world."

Desc6: cTimore's eyes well up with tears, a mixture of sadness and gratitude. He looks at Harmony, his voice trembling with emotion. "Thank you, brave heroine.
