Desc1: Goblin is present
    You enter a once beautiful kitchen, full of what seems to be magical cooking appliances unbeknownst to you.  Wires connect a metal box spitting out blackened bread.  More wires from the wall go to what appears to be a mini crane furiously spinning a metallic whip inside a bowl throwing cow’s milk across the white marbled countertop.  A type of wood stove expels heat from its open furnace at a remarkable heat despite there being no wood.  Cold air spills out of a compartmented box as frozen water leaks out of the top and various liquids spill out of the bottom half from flimsy transparent vessels.  The top of the stove has four discs burning as bright and red and angry as an armorsmith’s furnace.  Fire leaps from a pot on top of one those burning disc just as a horrific repeating squeal comes a tiny circle on the wall.
    Seemingly unphased by the obvious chaos around and possible inevitable conflagration, a goblin leaps from chair to table to wall and spots you but seems to not care.  In between several leaps it belches and throws its shoulders against the kitchen island that has been upturned and sits squarely against the pantry door.  The goblin’s voice squeals at the top of it’s obviously oversized lungs: “WEEK WEAK WEEK WEAK SHRIEK AGAIN PARVUS BECAUSE youWEEK  areWEAK WEEK” while shouldering the upturned island once more before turning it’s comically oversized eyes upon you.  What do you do?

Desc2: Goblin not present -- food present
    Wow.  The king and queen are not going to be happy to hear about the state of their poor kitchen.  Luckily at least the food still looks pretty good in here.  The magic cold box is still frigid too.  I wonder whats inside?

    The only way out of the kitchen is to the left back to the foyer.

Desc3: Food cooked
    Ugh.  The kitchen again.  Really starting to smell in here.  Glad I was sent to slay and not to clean.  The only way out is to the left.
